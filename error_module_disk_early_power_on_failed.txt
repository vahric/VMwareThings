After kill vm process and start VM sometime you can have this issue

"error module disk early power on failed"

Action 1 : 

Remove snapshot and start VM
Sometime if you are using vCloud Director you should migrate vm to another host to run


Action 2 :
Remove .lck files if you have and try restart again
