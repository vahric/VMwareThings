To List :
esxcli vm process list

To Kill :
esxcli vm process kill -type=xxxx -w=yyyyy

esxcli <conn_options> vm process kill --type <kill_type> --world-id <ID>

-type : 
The type of kill operation to attempt. There are three types of VM kills that can be attempted: [soft, hard, and force]. Users should always attempt 'soft' kills first, which will give the VMX process a chance to shutdown cleanly (like kill or kill -SIGTERM). If that does not work move to 'hard' kills which will shutdown the process immediately (like kill -9 or kill -SIGKILL). 'force' should be used as a last resort attempt to kill the virtual machine. If all three fail then a reboot is required
